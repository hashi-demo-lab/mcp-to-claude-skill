When selecting the best match, consider the following:
	- Name similarity to the query
	- Description relevance
	- Verification status (verified)
	- Download counts (popularity)
Return the selected module_id and explain your choice. If there are multiple good matches, mention this but proceed with the most relevant one.
If no modules were found, reattempt the search with a new moduleName query.
