/**
 * search_policies
 * Searches for Terraform policies based on a query string.
This tool returns a list of matching policies, which can be used to retrieve detailed policy information using the 'get_policy_details' tool.
You MUST call this function before 'get_policy_details' to obtain a valid terraform_policy_id.
When selecting the best match, consider the following:
	- Name similarity to the query
	- Title relevance
	- Verification status (verified)
	- Download counts (popularity)
Return the selected policyID and explain your choice. If there are multiple good matches, mention this but proceed with the most relevant one.
If no policies were found, reattempt the search with a new policy_query.
